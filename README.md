## Project1 Info

### Project1

#### Code
All the code for Project1 is stored in Project1.rkt in the Project1 folder
Naming Scheme: S_* denotes functions that alter state
               V_* denotes functions that return values
               SV_* denotes functions that alter state and return values

#### Tester file
There is an included `tester.rkt` file that is included that contains a way to quickly test a specific defined
test in the `tests` folder. All these tests come from the CANVAS page's given list of tests. Tests 1-20 are the
normal tests, and 20-28 are the extra challenge test. test.txt in the `tests` folder is a place to input your
own custom test. Instructions to run specific tests will be displayed once you run `tester.rkt`.
